Game Description:
The game I made was a simple first-person basketball game.

Instructions:
WSAD are used to move the character.
The space button jumps.
The mouse is used to control the player’s view.
Clicking the left mouse button creates a ball object.
Clicking it again destroys the ball.
Scrolling the mouse wheel increases the power of the throw.

3D Models & Texture:
I made the basketball hoop using Blender. The hoop has no texture, but I applied the materials and changed their colours.
The basketball, walls, and floor were made in Shiva. Their textures were found online.
I made the sky texture using GIMP.

Texture Sources:

Code:
Code for controlling the first-person camera was copied from the FirstPersonView game.
All the other code and the HUD were made by me.
