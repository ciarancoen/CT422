Testing the Server
The server creates a collection of 10 test accounts by default. 
The user can specify using a command line argument how many accounts they wish to create. 
Passing in a non-integer argument throws an error. 
Other command line arguments are discarded.

Default:

Passing an integer as an argument:

Passing a non-integer as an argument:


Testing the Client
The client takes between 4 and 6 arguments in the format: 
address port operation accountNumber [account | startDate endDate].
If the user enters anything less than four, they will get an error message. 
If they enter more than six, the excess arguments are discarded.
If the operation is withdraw, and an account number and an amount are given, the withdrawal operation is performed, and a message is returned to the user.
The deposit command works similarly.
The inquiry command only requires an account number. It returns the name and balance of the account, if it exists.
The statement account takes a start date and an end date and creates a statement for the user. The dates should be in the format day/month/year, e.g 13/10/2014

Withdraw:
For simplicity, the user may withdraw below €0.
